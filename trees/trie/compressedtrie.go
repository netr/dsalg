package trie

// In a compressed trie with digit numbers, each branch node has an additional field digitNumber that tells us which digit of the key is used to branch at this node.
// Figure 11 shows the compressed trie with digit numbers that corresponds to the trie of Figure 2. The leftmost field of each branch node of Figure 11 is the digitNumber field.
